# Housing-Price-Prediction-Model
Predict housing prices using a machine learning model. The model is built using a dataset that includes various features of houses such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of stories, and other amenities. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate a house's price based on its characteristics.

#### **Housing Price Prediction Model**

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts housing prices based on a set of features. The model is built using a Linear Regression algorithm in Python, leveraging popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

**Files in this Repository:**
* `Housing Model.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* `Housing.csv`: The dataset used to train the model. It includes various features of houses.

**Conclusion:**
The project successfully builds and evaluates a linear regression model to predict housing prices. The analysis includes a calculation of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R-squared score to assess the model's performance. The final output includes a scatter plot showing the actual versus predicted house prices, providing a visual representation of the model's accuracy.

#### **How to Run the Code**
To run this project, you will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    `git clone <https://github.com/abdullahhashmi01/Housing-Price-Prediction-Model/tree/main>`

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    * `pandas`
    * `numpy`
    * `scikit-learn`
    * `matplotlib`

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Open the `Housing Model.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, VS Code) and run the cells in order. The notebook will automatically handle the data loading, model training, and evaluation, and display the results.
